# Driving Simulator for Code 4 Community

Welcome to the Complicated Game repository! Code for Community is a college student organization dedicated to demonstrating and implementing the humanitarian impact of computer science. We code for non-profits, as well as teach programming. This driving simulator will (one day) be a tool that we use to teach Javascript and general programming concepts to individuals curious about computer science in high schools and middle schools. This game is meant to be of intermediate difficulty, between a "simple" game and more complex API interface. Thus, this project was dubbed the "complicated" game.

If you would like to run our program, please paste the code into an online interpreter and run it. If the game is unresponsive, click on the game screen and try again. We hope that you enjoy our project!
